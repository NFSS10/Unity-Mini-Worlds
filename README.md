# Unity - Mini Worlds
Mini worlds developed for an unreleased project that I never finished.

This project is a simple Unity 2019.2.5f1 project. It has a scene with two mini worlds and a object named "Player" that can be attracted to the worlds.
The objects are attracted when they are in range of the mini worlds attracting radius.


For a better example of how the project works, see the video below:
